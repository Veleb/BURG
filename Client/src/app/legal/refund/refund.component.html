    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>GST (as applicable)</li>
      <li>2% payment gateway processing fee</li>
    </ul>
    <p>

    <h2>2. 100% Refund – Agency or Equipment Fault</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Vehicle/machinery is broken, defective, or non-operational on arrival.</li>
      <li>Agency is at fault (e.g., wrong item delivered, refusal to deliver, unsafe condition).</li>
